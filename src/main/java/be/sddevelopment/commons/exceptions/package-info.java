/**
 * <p>
 *   When working with external/JDK libraries, the checked exceptions they throw
 *   sometimes prevent you from writing the code you want.
 *   The most common strategies of dealing with unwanted checked exceptions are:
 *      - ignoring them
 *      - converting them to unchecked exceptions
 *      - converting the return type to an Optional.empty()
 *      - handling them with an alternative flow / logging
